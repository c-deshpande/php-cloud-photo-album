# php-cloud-photo-album
A simple PHP and Dropbox based photo album.

Project done as a part of CSE-5335 Web Data Management Course at UTA.

Problem statement is as follows,

<p align="justify">You will develop a trivial photo-album application on Dropbox. This project is similar to Project 4 but
now you have to use Dropbox to store the photos and you need to be able to delete photos. Your task
is to modify your album.php script in your project6 directory to support the following operations:</p>

<p align="justify"> • Provide a form to upload a new image (a *.jpg). Look at the class slides for a PHP example that
handles uploads.</p>

<p align="justify"> • A display window that lists the names of the images in your dropbox directory. For each image
name you have a link that, when you click it, it downloads and displays the image in the image
section. Each image name also has a button to delete this image from the dropbox storage.</p>

<p align="justify"> • An image section that displays the selected image. You can change the image by changing the
src attribute value of the <img ...> element (you don't need Ajax; you just need to generate
Javascript from your album.php).</p>

<p align="justify">Note that the images that you display/delete are those stored in your dropbox
directory. You should not display any local images.</p>
